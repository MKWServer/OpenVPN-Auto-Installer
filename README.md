# OpenVPN-Auto-Installer
OpenVPN Auto Installer - Linux

This script will let you setup your own VPN server in no more than a minute or two, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

### Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://www.mkwserver.com/OpenVPN-Auto-Installer.sh -O OpenVPN-Auto-Installer.sh && bash OpenVPN-Auto-Installer.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.

### I want to run my own VPN but don't have a server for that
You can get a little VPS from just $1/month at [VirMach](https://billing.virmach.com/aff.php?aff=4539.
